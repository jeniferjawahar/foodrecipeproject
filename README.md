# 🍽️ Food Recipe App

A simple and responsive **Food Recipe App** built using **React** and **Vite**. Users can search for various recipes and view ingredients, instructions, and meal details using data fetched from an external API.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- ⚛️ React (with Hooks)
- ⚡ Vite (for fast development & build)
- 📦 Axios (for API calls)
- 🌐 TheMealDB API (or any recipe API)
- 💅 Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules (if used)

## ✨ Features

- Search for recipes by keyword (e.g., chicken, pasta)
- View recipe details:
  - Ingredients
  - Cooking instructions
  - Meal image
  - Category and area
- Clean and responsive UI for mobile and desktop
